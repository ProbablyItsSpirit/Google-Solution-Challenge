---

### ✅ **📌 Different Scenarios & AI Behavior:**
---

### **1️⃣ If you upload only the Question Paper (QP)**  
✅ AI will generate answers for each question.  
✅ If a book is uploaded, AI will **pull answers from it** instead of making them up.  

---

### **2️⃣ If you upload QP + Answer Sheet**  
✅ AI will **grade your answers** based on its own knowledge.  
✅ If a solution set/book exists, AI will use that as a reference instead (**better accuracy**).  
✅ AI will highlight mistakes, explain correct answers, and suggest improvements.  

---

### **3️⃣ If you upload only the Answer Sheet**  
✅ AI will **try to understand the questions** from the answers themselves.  
✅ If it can’t, it will ask for a **Question Paper** to grade properly.  
✅ If a solution set/book is available, it will use that to check correctness.  

---

### **4️⃣ If you upload only a Solution Set/Book**  
✅ AI saves it and will **use it in future grading** (instead of making up answers).  
✅ Works like a **reference manual** for all assignments & exams.  

---

### **5️⃣ If no marks are provided**  
✅ AI will ask you to **input marks per question** so it can grade accurately.  
✅ If marks are missing, AI will **try to estimate difficulty** & grade based on that.  

---

## ✅ **🧠 Advanced Features:**

---

### 🔥 **1. Understands Different Input Types**
- **Text answers** (typed in chat)  
- **Handwritten answers** (scanned images)  
- **Audio answers** (converts speech to text & grades it)  

---

### 🔥 **2. Suggests Better Answers**
- AI will show the **best way to write the answer** for better marks.  
- It will say **what’s missing, what’s extra, and how to improve it**.  

---

### 🔥 **3. Memory & Student Tracking**
- **Saves past answers & feedback** so students can track progress.  
- Teachers can see who’s improving and who needs help.
